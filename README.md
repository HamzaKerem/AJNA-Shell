# AJNA-Shell-ash-
A (work in progress) Linux Shell written in C.

Primitive version 0.1 out now. 

My goal is to create a unique shell with simple, elegant, pyhton-like syntax.
I've already implemented ideas that can be expressed very easily via the Command Line, compared to POSIX Compliant shell syntax.
I find POSIX Compliant shell syntax to be ugly and see the need for beginner-friendly syntax, as well syntax that is simply more pleasing to the eye.

Please check out the commands 'syntax' and 'help' for a quick guide.
